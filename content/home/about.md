<!-- I got my PhD from the University of Lugano, with Michele Lanza as advisor and my engineer degree from the Polytechnic University of TimiÅŸoara, with a thesis supervised by Radu Marinescu and Tudor Girba. I was as a visiting researcher at IBM TJ Watson Research Center in NY with Wim De Pauw. After my PhD I spent several years as a post-doctoral researcher in the Software Composition group led by Prof. Oscar Nierstrasz. In the summer of 2010 I was a visiting scientist in the lab of Crista Lopez at UC Irvine.

## Hi There!

I am assistant professor in the Computer Science Department of the [Johann Bernoulli Institute](http://www.rug.nl/research/jbi/) of the [Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences](http://www.rug.nl/research/fmns/?lang=en) of [University of Groningen](http://www.rug.nl/). I am member of the [SEARCH](http://www.cs.rug.nl/search/) group and also a member of the [DSSC](http://www.rug.nl/research/fmns/themes/dssc/) pioneers group which focuses on using data science in interdisciplinary research projects. I am part time visiting researcher in the SWAT group at [CWI](https://www.cwi.nl/research-groups/software-analysis-and-transformation) in Amsterdam. Before coming to the Netherlands I was a postdoc at the [University of Bern](http://scg.unibe.ch/) and a PhD student at the [University of Lugano](http://www.inf.usi.ch/), in Switzerland.

My research interests and expertise revolve around three main directions:

1. [Software Evolution](posts/evolution)
2. [Software Ecosystems](posts/ecosystems)
3. [Big Software Data](post/big_software_data/)
<!-- 4. [Accelerating Knowledge Acquisition](posts/aka)  -->


<!-- Office: 560, Bernoulliborg

Office Hours: Monday, 15 -- 17
