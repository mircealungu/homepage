<!-- I got my PhD from the University of Lugano, with Michele Lanza as advisor and my engineer degree from the Polytechnic University of TimiÅŸoara, with a thesis supervised by Radu Marinescu and Tudor Girba. I was as a visiting researcher at IBM TJ Watson Research Center in NY with Wim De Pauw. After my PhD I spent several years as a post-doctoral researcher in the Software Composition group led by Prof. Oscar Nierstrasz. In the summer of 2010 I was a visiting scientist in the lab of Crista Lopez at UC Irvine.

### Bio


Mircea is associate professor in CS at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/research). 

Before coming to Denmark he was assistant professor at the [Faculty of Science and Engineering](http://www.rug.nl/research/fmns/?lang=en) of [University of Groningen](http://www.rug.nl/) where he was a member of the [SEARCH](http://www.cs.rug.nl/search/) research group and the [Data Science Pioneers](http://www.rug.nl/research/fmns/themes/dssc/) group. He was also part time visiting researcher in the [SWAT](https://www.cwi.nl/research-groups/software-analysis-and-transformation) group at CWI in Amsterdam, a postdoc at the [University of Bern](http://scg.unibe.ch/), and a co-op researcher at [IBM TJ Watson Research Center](http://www.watson.ibm.com/index.shtml) in New York. He got his PhD working with [Michele Lanza](http://www.inf.usi.ch/lanza/) and the REVEAL research group at the [University of Lugano](http://www.inf.usi.ch/), in Switzerland.



<!-- I am assistant professor at the [University of Groningen](rug), in the Netherlands. I am working with the people in the [SEARCH](search) team led by [Paris Avgeriou](paris). I am the daily advisor of [Georgios Digkas](georgios). Some of my research interests are listed below. -->
 

<!-- ## Software Ecosystems

* Designing [ecosystem aware software development tools](post/big_software_data). 

* Organizing the [WEA international workshop series](wea) --  a venue for dicussing all things software ecossytems. The [2016 edition](wea) is in Copenhagen. 

* Bootstrapping an ecosystem aimed at accelerating the way people learn languages. The project is dubbed [Zeeguu](zeeguu).

* Long time ago I wrote a thesis on [reverse engineering software ecosystems](thesis). 


<br/>

## Software Evolution

* To better understand the evolution of a system is to [visualize its evolving architecture](softwarenaut). 

* To [control software evolution](dicto) is to allow the programmers to write down rules that must be respected by their systems.
