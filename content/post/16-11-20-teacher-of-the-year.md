summary = """
I have been nominated for the teacher of the year award. 
I consider this an honor that I do not deserve, especially
seeing all the other nominations. Blame it on the second 
year students who do not know better.

However, it is also true that we put a lot of effort in running the
projects and coming up with cool project ideas. The students 
enjoyed the team work and learned a lot in the process. 
Thus the majority 
of the merit goes to me TAs who helped run the projects: 
Laura, Jelle, Georgios, Jeroen, Angelo, 
Alexander, Sybren. Congratulations!!

I've been long due to write up the lessons learned during 
the SE courses at RUG. Now I feel the duty to do it even more. 
Hopefully before I start the next batch!
