I have been nominated for the teacher of the year award! 
I consider this an honor that I do not deserve as an individual, 
especially seeing all the other nominations. However, it is also 
true that together with my team, we put a lot of effort in 
  coming up with cool project ideas and 
  running them
in the timespan of five months. 
The (vast majority of the) students reported enjoying team work on real projects and 
learning a lot in the process. 

Thus, many thanks and congratulations for my teaching assistants: 
Laura, Jelle, Georgios, Jeroen, Angelo, 
Alexander, Sybren.

I've been long due to write up the lessons learned during 
the SE courses at RUG. Now I feel the duty to do it even more. 
Hopefully before I start the next batch!
