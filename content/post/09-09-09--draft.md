Between mid-november and mid-december I have been visiting researcher at the PLEIAD Lab at the University of Chile. I gave a master lecture, talked to various people including Romain Robbes, Eric Tanter, Alex Bergel, Johan Fabry, and closely worked with Romain Robbes with whom we submitted a paper to ICSE NIER. A pleasant and productive time!
