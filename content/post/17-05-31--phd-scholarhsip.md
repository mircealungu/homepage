## The Scholarship
I am glad to announce that I have funding for a PhD scholarship in the the Software Engineering and Architecture Research Group at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. 

The Software Engineering and Architecture Research Group ([SEARCH](http://www.cs.rug.nl/search/Main/People)) carries research in software engineering in general with particular interest in architecture, cloud computing, software evolution analysis, and intelligent tools for software development. This particular position is mainly targeted at candidates who have a strong background and interest in one of the following research directions:

- software analysis and visualization
- software ecosystem evolution and monitoring
- adaptable, personalized, and intelligent tools and systems

However, if your interest is different and you can provide a strong argument on why your topic would be relevant for software engineering research I would be happy to hear from you.

As a PhD student you have a salary and you are an employee with full rights of the University of Groningen. You have the chance of doing cutting-edge research in software engineering and you have the option of  becoming involved also in teaching and assisting courses. You should also be ready to travel, since part of your job will be traveling to conferences and to present your results. 

The University of Groningen, one of the oldest universities in the Netherlands, is home to a vibrant international student body. The university constantly ranks as one of the best universities in the world ( currently ranked [59](http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2017.html) ).
