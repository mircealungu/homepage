I am glad to announce that I have started as Associate Professor at the IT University in Copenhagen.
I will be teaching Software Architecture, Technical Interaction Desgin, and Advanced Software Engineering. I will also be continuing my work on software evolution, software ecosystems, and using technology to enhance personalized learning.
