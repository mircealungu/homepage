The SEN symposium in Amsterdam is a yearly event that gathers software engineering researchers and practitioners. This year I was invited to give a talk along several other great researchers and practitioners including: Felienne Hermans, Andreas Zeller, and Hans Wanders the CIO of the Netherlands!

The organizers have equiped the participants with voting cards: yellow and 
red. This is a nice idea, since you can interact with the audience in a more
playful manner. At some point, I asked the audience to lift their red cards if they 
prefer to read War and Peace and the yellow cards if they'd prefer to read
the source code of ArgoUML.
