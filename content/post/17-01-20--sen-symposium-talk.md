# Context in Software Analytics
I started my talk observing that Google has very relevant search 
results because they take the context of the search into account.

I then argued that our work in software analytics becomes more relevant 
and powerful if we take the context into into account. I discussed 
in particular three types of context that I have encountered in 
my work:

- **The Temporal** context allows our analysis to benefit from the 
temporal locality of the software evolution process 
- **The (Eco)Systemic** context allows us to understand a system in the
broader context in which it interacts with other systems
- **The Personal** context allows our tools to adapt
to the particular needs of the individual developer and become
what Vannevar Bush envisioned *"intimate supplements of the human mind"*

# Fun with the Audience
The organizers have provided the participants with voting cards: yellow and 
red. This is a nice idea, since you can interact with the audience in a more
playful manner. At some point, I asked the audience to lift their red cards if they 
prefer to read War and Peace and the yellow cards if they'd prefer to read
the source code of ArgoUML.
