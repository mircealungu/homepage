The SEN symposium in Amsterdam is a yearly event that gathers software engineering researchers and practitioners. This year I was invited to give a talk along several other great researchers and practitioners including: Felienne Hermans, Andreas Zeller, and Hans Wanders the CIO of the Netherlands! 

In my talk I argued that our work in software analytics is more relevant 
if we take into account three types of context in our analysis: 

- **The Temporal** context allows our analysis to benefit from the 
temporal locality of the software evolution process 
- **The (Eco)Systemic** context allows us to understand a system in the
broader context of it's ecosystem
- **The Personal** context allows our tools to adapt
to the particular needs of the individual.

These are the slides of my talk are [online](/pdf/SEN-Symposium--TalkSlides.pdf)

The organizers have equiped the participants with voting cards: yellow and 
red. This is a nice idea, since you can interact with the audience in a more
playful manner. At some point, I asked the audience to lift their red cards if they 
prefer to read War and Peace and the yellow cards if they'd prefer to read
the source code of ArgoUML.
