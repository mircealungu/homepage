I started my talk observing that Google, Facebook, and Twitter 
are using context in order to provide us with the best... ads! 
I then argued that in software analytics we can use context in 
order to create more powerful tools and analyses. 



In particular I discussed three types of context that I have experienced
with in my work:


1. **The Temporal** context allows us to replay the evolution 
of the system to better understand it 
1. **The (eco)Systemic** context allows us to understand a system in the
broader context in which it interacts with other systems
1. **The Personal** context allows our analytics tools to become *"intimate 
supplements of the human mind"* (Vannevar Bush)

# A Fun Audience
The organizers have provided the participants with voting cards: yellow and 
red. This is a nice idea, since you can interact with the audience in a more
fun manner. 


At some point, I took a picture of the audiencve after I asked them to lift their red cards if they 
prefer to read War and Peace and the yellow cards if they'd prefer to read
the source code of ArgoUML.

Looking at the three yellow cards, it seems
that in the audience there were three people who read War and Peace :)
