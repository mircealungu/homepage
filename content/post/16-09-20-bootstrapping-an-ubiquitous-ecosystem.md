My favorite reviewer for this paper says: 

> "An unconventional idea for an ecosystem, which shows well that there are many more opportunities to benefit from the ecosystem idea, than the various industrial applications. The concrete examples of the platform and the applications make the ideas tangible and well understandable. I particularly like the discussions of the lessons learned" 

Published in the WEA'16 workshop the paper ([pdf](https://github.com/mircealungu/Bootstrapping_an_Ecosystem__WEA16/blob/master/preprint.pdf)) reports on some of the opportunities and challenges of bootstrapping a ubiquitous monitoring ecosystem. As a case study I report on my experience with the [Zeeguu](https://zeeguu.unibe.ch) ecosystem.

This was a very nice review to read. 

The other reviews were also positive, so the paper on Bootstrapping a Ubiquitous Monitoring Ecosystem ([preprint online](https://github.com/mircealungu/Bootstrapping_an_Ecosystem__WEA16/blob/master/preprint.pdf)) was accepted for presentation at WEA (Workshop on Ecosystem Architectures) that will take place in Copenhagen and is colocated with ECSA.

The paper talks about some of the challenges and 
opportunities that come with bootstrapping a 
ubiquitous monitoring ecosystem. It is a case 
study inspired from our [Zeeguu](https://zeeguu.unibe.ch) ecosystem.
