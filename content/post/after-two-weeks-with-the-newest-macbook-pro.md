you love
- the touchID login. not having to type passwords is 
a wonderful thing
- love the color of the thing
- the lightness of the thing - it wheighs very little
- love the usb-c plugs: sharing the 
charger between the laptop and mobile phone is cool. 
being able to plug the laptop on either side is wonderful. 

you could see yourself loving maybe
- when you select text in a pdf the touch bar allows 
you to select the style. this could be nice for those
who write in Pages. and don't have keyboard shortcuts.

upgrade. or?
- up / down keys don't really work. they're too small. 
on the bright side, this forced me to install the better
touch tool. this is a wonderful utility that allows you 
to map various key combinations on various others. 
with this thing installed, i am using command+{vim 
naviation keys} for navigation. much nicer than trying 
to find the up/down arrows.
