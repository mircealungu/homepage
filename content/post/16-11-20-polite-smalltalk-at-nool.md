The programming languages reseachers have a healthy sense of humor. 
**The -1th edition** of the NOOL (New Object Oriented Languages) 
Workshop had a very creative call for papers. 
To keep up with the state of affairs, Jan Kurs and I submitted a paper 
([preprint pdf](https://github.com/mircealungu/Polite_Programmers__NOOL16/blob/master/preprint.pdf)) with a most concise abstract:

> JavaProgrammersUseCamelCaseToSeparateWordsInIdentifiers. <br/>
   Pythonistas_and_others_use_underscore_in_their_identifiers. <br/>
   Polite programmers can use spaces if they like.

The paper presents briefly some of the design decisions that went into Polite, our evolutionary mutation of Smalltalk that brings the language 
closer to natural language.
